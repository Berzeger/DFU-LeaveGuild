# DFU-LeaveGuild
Leave Guild mod for Daggerfall Unity

This mod allows you to leave a guild without any repercussions. Useful in situations where you wish to join another temple, but don't want to decrease your reputation to the negative numbers. Simply talk to a guild member and there you'll find a new improvised button exactly for that!

Should you wish to rejoin the guild, don't worry. You get your earned reputation and rank back!

I wrote this simple mod after I joined a temple and after several hours of gameplay found out I can no longer join any other temples without destroying my hard work for the first temple.

Disclaimer: I didn't test this mod in the Dark Brotherhood or The Thieves Guild. No warranty given what happens if you decide to leave them... :)

The release package of this mod can be found at https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/588.
Written and compiled using Daggerfall Unity v1.0.0, using Unity 3D 2019.4.40f1.
